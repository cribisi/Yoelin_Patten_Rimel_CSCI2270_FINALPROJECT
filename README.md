Project Summary:
----------------

For our CSCI2270 project, we will be building a text based dungeon
 crawler in which the user will choose their own path to traverse 
through the map. The game will also include an item inventory (to boost the stats of the user),
 an experienced-based leveling system and of course a final boss. A binary tree will be used as the
 game board and dynamic arrays will be used to represent the player’s inventory and equipment. The 
game board will be randomly generated for each instance of the game.  At any given time the player will be
 located at a node in the game board. At each node, the player will be posed with two movement choices
 corresponding to the two nodes under the player’s current node (analogous to choosing between two doors).
 The user must collect certain items throughout the map in order to fight the boss; the boss will be set to
 the nodes at the bottom of each branch such that the player must fight the final boss in order to win the 
game. Once the boss fight is initiated, the player will receive a number of “dice rolls” (a random number), 
which will correspond to damage dealt to the boss. The higher the player's experience, the more rolls the player
 will be alloted. Good luck!
